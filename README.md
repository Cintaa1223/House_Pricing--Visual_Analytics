# House_Pricing--Visual_Analytics
This is a university project where we create a machine learning algorithm for predicting house pricing in Seattle.

This is a project for University about house pricing by Oriol Gallego (OriolGallego2001) and I.
Here we use tools like Jupyter Notebook, Tableau and VisualStudio Code for streamlit to analyze the data of a CSV file that contain information about many houses in Seattle. We talk about data preprocessing and interpretation of a machine learning model. We use this model to display the results and useful plots in streamlit and to allow people to add more data into the dataset and predict whether a house with some characteristics is above the average price in Seattle. There is also a section about data interpretation done in tableau that annalyzes the current pricing situation and some curious outliers.
